A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

        Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

        Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int X, int Y, int D); }

that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

        For example, given:
        X = 10
        Y = 85
        D = 30

        the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

        after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
        after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
        after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

        Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
        X â‰¤ Y.
